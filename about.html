<h1>About</h1>
  
  <p style="border: 2px solid #333"></p>
  
  <p>I am currently a fourth year Ph.D candidate in the Quantitative Psychology program at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/"><b>University of Virginia</b></a>. I am working in the Mathematical Psychology Lab, where 
  <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~tv9c/"><b>Timo von Oertzen</b></a> is my advisor. I also spend time working in the <a href="http://www.socialdevelopmentlab.org/"><b>Social Development Lab</b></a> 
  in the Curry School of Education with my secondary advisor, <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~ser4x/"><b>Sara Rimm-Kaufman</b></a>, and in the <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/labgroup/"><b>Implicit Social Cognition Lab</b></a>
  with <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/"><b>Brian Nosek</b></a>. Broadly, my interests lie in exploratory data analysis and visualization, data mining, increasing reproducibility in the scientific process (especially with respect to data analysis),
  and I also have a substantive interest in math engagement and achievement. If you look around, you'll find some of my current projects, publications, presentations, and relevant code.
