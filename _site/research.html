<h3><font size = 5>Unsupervised Learning for Longitudinal Data</font></h3>

  The incorporation of exploratory longitudinal analysis techniques, namely identifying hetereogeneous sub-populations based on longitudinal trajectories,
  can provide new avenues to answer theoretically interesting research questions that often remain unanswered after traditional confirmatory measures
  have already been exhausted. While many techniques to accomplish this task exist, a common method used in psychology is the growth mixture model.
  Recent simulations have found that this analytic method shows a decline in performance for smaller sample sizes commonly found in psychological research.
  This raises the question: are there better methods available for smaller sample sizes? Using Monte Carlo simulations, I compared growth mixture models with
  other clustering methods, ranging on a spectrum from not-informed to very-informed, across different simulation conditions. Results indicated that despite this
  decreased performance for smaller sample sizes, growth mixture models still outperform simpler, more general clustering methods.
  
<h3><font size = 5>Supervised Learning for Multilevel Data</font></h3>
  
  There is an increasing number of datasets with a large amount of participants, variables, or both, in education and other fields that often deal with
  multilevel data structures. With this increase of information, it becomes necessary to be able to efficiently identify variables of interest for further study on a validation
  set or for a future project. Unfortunately, very little work has been done on investigating the performance of popular data mining techniques, such as those based on
  recursive partitioning, when applied to multilevel data structures. I am currently exploring these ideas further for my dissertation project.

<h3><font size = 5>Crowdsourcing Research: Many Analysts, One Dataset</font></h3>

  In a standard scientific analysis, one analyst or team presents a single analysis of a data set.
  However, there are often a variety of defensible analytic strategies that could be used on the same data.
  <a href="http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/programmes/research-programmes/phd/phd-students-a-z/raphael-silberzahn/">Raphael Silberzahn</a>,
  <a href="http://www.socialjudgments.com/">Eric Uhlmann</a>, <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/">Brian Nosek</a>,
  and I are currently pursuing a project examining this potential variability in more detail. If you are interested in finding out
  more information, please see our <a href="https://osf.io/gvm2z/">project website</a> on the Open Science Framework.
 
<h3><font size = 5>Student Engagement in Elementary School Mathematics</font></h3>

  In collaboration with <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~ser4x/">Dr. Sara Rimm-Kaufman's</a> <a href="http://www.socialdevelopmentlab.org/">
  Social Development Lab</a> in the Curry School of Education, I am working on a project assessing how student engagement in math is related to both
  math self-efficacy and teacher-student interactions. We found that we found that there was a positive relationship between student self-efficacy in math
  and both social and emotional engagement in math. However, this effect was only present in classrooms with low to average levels of teacher emotional support.
  In classrooms with high levels of teacher emotional support, students reported similar levels of both social and emotional engagement, regardless of self-efficacy.
