<h1>About</h1>
  
  <p style="border: 2px solid #333"></p>
  
  <p> I am currently a fellow at the July 2015 <a href="http://insighthealthdata.com/"><b>Insight Health Data Science</b></a> program in Boston, MA. I recently completed my Ph.D in the Quantitative Psychology program at the <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/"><b>University of Virginia</b></a>.
  I worked primarily in the Mathematical Psychology Lab, where <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~tv9c/"><b>Timo von Oertzen</b></a> was my advisor. I also spent time working in the <a href="http://www.socialdevelopmentlab.org/"><b>Social Development Lab</b></a> 
  in the Curry School of Education with my secondary advisor, <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~ser4x/"><b>Sara Rimm-Kaufman</b></a>, and in the <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/labgroup/"><b>Implicit Social Cognition Lab</b></a>
  with <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/"><b>Brian Nosek</b></a>. Broadly, research spanned exploratory data analysis, visualization, and data mining (particularly in education research), as well as increasing reproducibility in the scientific process
  (especially with respect to data analysis). If you look around, you will find some of my recent projects, publications, presentations, and relevant code.
